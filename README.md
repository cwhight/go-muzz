# Basic Dating App

`go 1.18`

## Run the App

`go run cmd/main.go`

Application will start at `http://localhost:3000/`

## Limitations

This app was created as a tech test, in the interest of time some things have been left as essentially dummy code, to enable producing most of the solution in a shorter space of time, documenting the main limitations here:

- Only Handler layer logic has been implemented properly, the DB layer simply responds with dummy code as opposed to actually querying the DB and returning a real response. The method signatures themselves would remain unchanged and the DB layer could and would be implemented independently
- No testing is done on any part of the application
- Passwords are not encrypted etc. (they're not even stored) and just compared as plain text
- authentication is done using an `access-token` cookie, rather than using an `Authorization` header, not necessarily a limitation just clarification of the feature
- filtering results not implemented
